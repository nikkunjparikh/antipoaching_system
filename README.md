# antipoaching_system
This repository detects animal distress sounds with MFCC-based audio processing and machine learning. It can be used to monitor forests in real time, and potentially prevent poaching by identifying distress calls and alerting authorities. The system is a scalable, non-invasive option for wildlife protection and conservation.
